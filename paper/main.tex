\section{Theoretical background}

The area of a subset $S \subseteq \RR^2$ of the plane is denoted by
$\lambda(S)$. We will denote the boundary of $S$ by $\partial S$. For two points
$x,y \in \RR^2$, the closed line segment with endpoints in $x$ and $y$ is
denoted $[x,y]$. For $p \in [1, \infty]$, we define the $p$-ball as $B_{p}(x,
\varepsilon) = \set{y \in \RR^2 : \norm{x-y}_p \leq \varepsilon}$ and we will
only be interested in the closed case. Unless otherwise stated, we shall operate
in the Euclidean world with $p = 2$. Throughout we shall assume that $P
\subseteq \RR^2$ is a simple bounded closed polygon. The class of such polygons
is given by $\PP$. Its perimeter is denoted by $\abs{\partial P}$.

\subsection{The $\alpha$-fatness score}

One approach to measuring the relative ``fatness'' of a polygon seeks to
identify regions of the shape which behave highly unlike balls.

\begin{definition}
  The $\alpha$-fatness score of a polygon $P$ is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \alpha(P) = \inf\set{\frac{\lambda[P \cap B(x,
    \varepsilon)]}{\lambda[B(x,\varepsilon)]} : \varepsilon > 0, x \in P}
  \end{equation*}
  where we impose that the ball $B(x,\varepsilon)$
  does not contain $P$. 
  \label{def:alpha}
\end{definition}

The constraint that $P \not\subseteq B(x,\varepsilon)$ ensures definiteness:
otherwise, let $\varepsilon \to \infty$ and the ratio $\frac{\lambda[P \cap B(x,
\varepsilon)]}{\lambda[B(x, \varepsilon)]}$ always approaches $0$. An intuition
for $\alpha(P)$ emerges from considering how it behaves on balls.

\begin{proposition}
  For any $P$, $\alpha(P) \leq \frac{1}{4}$, and if $P = B(x_0, r)$
  then we have equality.
  \label{prop:alpha}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  To show that $\alpha(P) \leq \frac{1}{4}$, it suffices to show only for convex
  $P$, because $P \subseteq \conv(P)$ implies $\lambda[P \cap B(x, \varepsilon)]
  \leq \lambda[\conv(P) \cap B(x, \varepsilon)]$. Let $d = \diam (P)$ and fix
  $x,y \in \partial P$ such that $\abs{[x,y]} = d$. Assume without loss of
  generality that $x$ lies above $y$, and consider the ball $B(x, d)$. Then $P$
  does not meet the upper disk of $B(x,d)$, for otherwise we could choose $z \in
  P$ in the upper disk of $B(x,d)$ which forms a chord of $P$ longer than $d$.
  A similar argument shows that $P$ cannot occupy more than half of the lower
  disk of $B(x,d)$. Hence
  \begin{equation*}
    \alpha(P) \leq \frac{\lambda[P \cap B(x,d)]}{\lambda[B(x,d)]} \leq
    \frac{1}{4},
  \end{equation*}
  as needed.

  The fact that $\alpha(B(x_0, r)) = \frac{1}{4}$ relies on a neat
  result \cite{10.2307/30044198} that shows that the $L_p$
  ellipsoid $\EE$ with radii $a, b$ has area
  \begin{equation*}
    \lambda(\EE) = a b \cdot 4
    \frac{\Gamma(1+\frac{1}{p})^2}{\Gamma(1+\frac{n}{p})}.
  \end{equation*}
  In our case, $\alpha(B(x_0, r))$ is achieved at a ball on a ``corner'' point
  with radius $2r$.
\end{proof}

Hence, the $\alpha$-score is greater for polygons which exhibit ``niceness''
characteristics. It is not affected tremendously by local nonconvexity in $P$ so
long as $P$ ``snugly fits'' into a ball shape, which is a global property.

\subsection{The chord-$f$ score}

A different class of ``fatness'' measures arises through partitioning $P$ into
two (interior disjoint) polygons $P = P' \cup P''$ via chords. A chord is a pair
$x,y \in \partial P$ such that the segment $[x,y]$ is contained in the interior
of $P$ except at the endpoints $x$ and $y$. Such a chord defines a partition of
$P = P' \cup P''$ by orientation, so that $\partial P'$ is the arc from $x$ to
$y$ together with $[x,y]$ and that $\partial P''$ is the arc from $y$ to $x$
together with $[x,y]$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $f : \mathcal{P} \to \RR$. For a given $P \in \mathcal{P}$, its
  \emph{chord-$f$ score} is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    s_f (P) = \inf \set{\max(f(P'), f(P'')) : x, y \in \partial P}
  \end{equation*}
  where the chord $[x,y]$ partitions $P = P' \cup P''$.
  \label{def:chord-f}
\end{definition}

The intuition for $f$ is some global measure of ``cost'' associated with respect
to $P$. For example, if $f(P) = \abs{\partial P}$, then $s_f$ identifies the
partition (or limiting sequence of partitions) which minimizes the maximum
subpolygon perimeter. Indeed, measures such as perimeter or area are the typical
choices of $f$, but any suitable property of $P$  may be employed. 

The chord-$f$ score can be understood relatively simply in the context of a
minimax game. Max, given a polygon with a chord partitioning it, always chooses
the subpolygon associated with a greater $f$ (i.e., the worst cost of the
partition). Min, who plays first, tries to find a chord with the least-bad worst
cost with respect to $f$.

The member of this class of scores under this present investigation is
$\chordarc$, the so-called \emph{chord-arc} score. It is important to note that
the length of the chord $[x,y]$ which partitions $P$ is included in the
estimation of $\chordarc$. One implication of this is that the chord-arc score
need not be bounded above by $\frac{\abs{\partial P}}{2}$.  We have several
facts about $\chordarc$ which develop further intuition for the score.
\begin{proposition}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $R$ be a rectangle with height $h$ and length $\ell$. Assume that
      $h \leq \ell$. Then $\chordarc(R) = 2h + \ell$.
    \item Let $P$ be convex with perimeter $\abs{\partial P} = w$. Then
      $\chordarc(P) \leq \frac{w}{2} + \diam (P)$.
    \item Let $C$ be a circle with ``perimeter'' $2\pi r$. Then $\chordarc(C) =
      (\pi + 2)r$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \label{rem:chordarc}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item That the optimal partition bisects $R$ is readily apparent,
      for this minimizes the maximum perimeter length of either sub-rectangle.
      A case analysis confirms that the preferred strategy for Min is to choose
      a chord along the smaller dimension (i.e., $h$) to bisect $R$, and in this
      case the maximum arc length is $2h + 2\left( \frac{\ell}{2} \right) = 2h +
      \ell$, as needed.
    \item For $P$ convex, a perimeter-bisecting chord, whose length is at most
      $\diam(P)$, always exists. 
    \item This follows from part 2 by noticing that the length of \emph{any}
      perimeter-bisecting chord is $\diam(C) = 2r$. \qedhere
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\section{Overview of empirical design}

In principal of computing the $\alpha$ and chord-$f$ scores relies on sweeping
the continuum of points of $P$ and evaluating the aforementioned measurements.
To estimate this process in practice, we employ the following discretizing
scheme. Let $P$ be determined by the vertices $[v_1, \dots, v_n]$ given in
counterclockwise order. Then, given $\delta > 0$, loop through the vertices of
$P$, checking if $\norm{v_{i+1} - v_i} > \delta$. In the case where this holds,
we insert $v_i' = \frac{v_i + v_{i+1}}{2}$ after $v_i$ into the polygon and
resume the loop. This ensures that for any two adjacent vertices $v_{i}$ and
$v_{i+1}$ in the representation of $P$ we have $\norm{v_{i+1} - v_i} \leq
\delta$. As $\delta \to 0$ this estimates $\partial P$ more exactly. All
computations are done with respect to the $L_{\infty}$ norm. The implementation
of this procedure is given in Algorithm \ref{alg:delta}.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \begin{algorithmic}[0]
    \Procedure{RefineBy}{$P,\delta$}
    \State{$P = [v_1, v_2, v_3, \dots, v_n]$};
    \State{$v = v_1$}
    \While {$\textit{next}(v) \ne v_1$}
    \If {$\norm{\textit{next}(v) - v}_2 > \delta$}
      \State{\textrm{Insert $\textit{midpoint}(v, \textit{next}(v))$ into $P$
      after $v$}} 
      \Comment{Now $\textit{next}(v)$ is the midpoint}
      \EndIf
      \EndWhile
      \EndProcedure
    \end{algorithmic}
    \label{alg:delta}
\end{algorithm}

Given a $\delta$-refined polygon $P$, the computation of $\alpha(P)$ is
relatively straightforward, with the simplification that points $x$ on which the
ratio is computed lie on $\partial P$. The computation steps through $[v_1,
\dots, v_n]$ and for each $v_i$ the radius $\varepsilon$ of the
minimum-enclosing $\infty$-ball centered at $v_i$ is computed. Then for
$\varepsilon_k = \frac{k}{100} \varepsilon$, $k = 1, \dots, 100$, the ratio 
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\lambda[P \cap B_{\infty}(v_i, \varepsilon_k)]}{B_{\infty}(v_i,
  \varepsilon_k)}
\end{equation*}
is computed and the smallest such ratio is kept. The minimum over all $v_i$ is
given as $\alpha(P)$. The implementation of the $\alpha$ score is given in
Algorithm \ref{alg:alpha}. 

%% Pseudocode for the alpha score

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \begin{algorithmic}[0]
    \Function{$\alpha$Score}{$P$}
    \State{$P = [v_1, v_2, v_3, \dots, v_n]$};
    \State{$\textrm{min} = \infty$}
    \For {$v \in P$}
    \State{$\varepsilon = \textrm{radius of minimum enclosing ball of $P$ at
    $v$}$}
    \For {$k = 1, 2, \dots, 100$} \Comment{$100$ is arbitrary}
    \State{$\varepsilon_k = \frac{k}{100} \varepsilon$}
    \State{$\textrm{area} = \frac{\lambda[P \cap B_{\infty}(v, \varepsilon_k)]}{B_{\infty}(v, \varepsilon_k)}$}
    \If {$\textrm{min} > \textrm{area}$}
      \State{$\textrm{min} = \textrm{area}$}
      \EndIf
      \EndFor
      \EndFor
      \State{\Return{\textrm{min}}}
      \EndFunction
    \end{algorithmic}
  \label{alg:alpha}
\end{algorithm}

Similarly, given a $\delta$-refined polygon $P$, the chord-$f$ score is computed
by sweeping all possible chords of $P$. For each point $v_i, v_j \in \partial P$
with $i < j$, if $[v_i, v_j]$ is indeed a valid chord of $P$, the partition $P =
P' \cup P''$ is computed and the maximum of $f(P')$ and $f(P'')$ is kept. The
minimum such value is given as $s_f(P)$. The implementation of the chord-$f$
score is given in Algorithm \ref{alg:chordf}.

%% Pseudocode for the chord f score

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\begin{algorithmic}[0]
  \Function{ChordScore}{P,f}
  \State{$P = [v_1, v_2, v_3, \dots, v_n]$};
  \For {$v \in P$}
  \For {$w \in [\textit{next}(v), \dots, v_n]$}
  \If {$[v,w]$ is a chord of $P$}
    \State{Partition $P = P' \cup P''$ by $[v,w]$}
    \State{$\textrm{submax} = \textit{max}(f(P'), f(P''))$}
    \If {$\textrm{min} > \textrm{submax}$}
      \State{$\textrm{min} = \textrm{submax}$}
      \EndIf
    \EndIf
  \EndFor
  \EndFor
  \State{\Return{\textrm{min}}}
  \EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:chordf}
\end{algorithm}

All of these algorithms are implemented in CGAL \cite{cgal:eb-18a} with the
extensive use of the 2D Polygon library \cite{cgal:gw-p2-18a}.


\section{Empirical results}


We evaluate our measurements on randomly generated polygons with vertices in the
unit square $[0,1] \times [0,1]$. We consider collections of such polygons of
10, 50, and 100 vertices. In Figure \ref{fig:delta}, we measure the effect of
sweeping $\delta$ between $0.05$ and $1$ on the resulting measurements. Figure
\ref{fig:alph-inft-10} shows a comparison of $\alpha$-fatness and
${\chordarc}_{\infty}$ scores for polygons on 10 vertices. Figure
\ref{fig:alph-one-50} shows a similar comparison of $\alpha$-fatness and
${\chordarc}_{1}$ scores for polygons on 50 vertices.
