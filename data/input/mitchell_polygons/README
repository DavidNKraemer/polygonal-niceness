One instance of each of 150, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450,
600, 700, 800, 900, 1000
and one of each of these SMOOTHED.

Now there are TEN instances of each of the 
sizes (10, 50, 100, 200, 500), each with
a smoothed version.

ALSO:  in the 50 directory there are

4.poly	4s.poly  4ss.poly  4sss.poly  4ssss.poly

which are the polygon 4.poly (with 50 vertices),
smoothed once, twice, etc, up to 4 times.

It would be interesting to plot the upper/lower bounds
as a function of i=#times smoothed (i=0,1,2,3,4)

Each case uses a call to random points to generate n
points uniformly in a square,
then apply the "2-opt moves" method.  This gives i.poly
in directory n, for i=1,2,3 (different calls to the random points
generator).
The "1s.poly" is the "smoothed" version of 1.poly,
and it has size 2n if 1.poly has size n.
